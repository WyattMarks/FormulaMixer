parts:

micro (ESP? ATMEGA? PIC?)
    probs ESP

LCD (Character? Full Color? Touch?)
    probs just a large character LCD

buttons (SMD? Separate?)
    SMD with some sort of large shell or something would be best
        or maybe even THT fancy buttons

Optical Encoder

Stepper controllers

12->3.3V voltage conversion
    check if my 5V -> 3.3V converter is tolerant of 12V 
        if not, maybe get a 12->5V converter and use that in conjunction with 5->3.3? will this need 5V at all?

connectors 
 - Stepper Motor (probably use the built in ones, so need to buy some of those + crimpers)
 - maybe an internal fan? not sure how much current will be running through pcb
 - LCD connection... if we use a new character LCD there will be lots of pins running from LCD to micro. maybe ribbon cable?
